# THings to do

# Install Ceres in directory
# 1. git clone ceres (git clone https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver)
# 2. checkout tag 2.1.0 (git checkout 2.1.0)
# 2. install the dependencies (Straight from website)


# IDEA: Have a setup blurb explaining the software that's required, versions. Be clear of what's going to be installed globally. 
# TODO: When naming the ceres-solver folder, make sure to put the version in, much like the actual CERES documentation.

# Commands for installing Ceres
#   git clone https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver
#   git checkout 2.1.0
#   <Copy the install deps from the website>

# Commands for building Ceres
#   <Copy the build procedure from website + add export functionality>

# Wrong
# 3. run cmake using the appropriate flag to export the cmakelist (cmake ../ceres-solver -DEXPORT_BUILD_DIR=ON)
